### **Matthew Gerace**
I am a Software Engineer in New York City passionate about fostering my abilities to create applications and models that enhance everyday experiences. Learning new and perfecting known computational skills fascinates me. I am drawn to complex problems, and even more so captivated by deriving elegant solutions. My personal work and research typically reflect my strong interest in Full-Stack and Backend Development as well as exploring modern frameworks and cutting-edge technologies. I perpetually find joy in broadening my breadth of knowledge and experiences.

### **Experience**

My early professional career is diverse. I seek out opportunities that truly excite me, offer new perspectives, and encourage learning. As I am fully immersed into a new opportunity, I continuously find satisfaction in reaching solutions, breakthroughs, or improvements. I am thankful for how each experience has shaped my mindset and skills and has even inspired me in my own projects. There is something valuable I have taken away from each project, team member, and situation.

I currently work as a Software Engineer for [Annalect](https://www.annalect.com/).

During my undergraduate career, I interned as a Software Engineer for [Legna Software](https://www.legnasoftware.com/).

As a student, I also worked as an undergraduate researcher with the [UVA Biocomplexity Insitute](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/) in the Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing (NSAAC) division. Here I have collaborated closely with established researchers on finding solutions to reduce the spread of hospital acquired infections using data science, graph theory, and machine learning algorithms.

### **Education**

I have the honor of graduating from the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/) with a Bachelor of Science in [Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) in 2023. In the same time, I also earned a [Statistics](https://statistics.as.virginia.edu) bachelor's degree and the [Engineering Business](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/engineering-and-society/entrepreneurship-and-business) minor.

My undergraduate experience introduced me to many diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and ideas. I spent months as a DevOps manager developing a University Web Application, interned for two technology startups ([Valor Biomechanics](https://www.valorbiomechanics.com/) & [Legna Software](https://www.legnasoftware.com/)), researched and presented on various hospital acquired infections with the [UVA Biocomplexity Insitute](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/), volunteered to establish a sustainable housing community, and represented my class through a variety of student councils. While enjoying my undergraduate experience at the University of Virginia and in Charlottesville, my natural curiosity, care for community, and creativity flourished. As I explore new communities and growth opportunities, I look towards continuing to embrace diversity in life and building upon the foundations set forth here.
