### **Matthew Gerace**
I am a student at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) in the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/). Specifically, I study [Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) and [Statistics](https://statistics.as.virginia.edu), and plan to complete an [Engineering Business Minor](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/engineering-and-society/entrepreneurship-and-business). I am extremely fascinated by learning new and perfecting known computational skills. Additionally, I am passionate about fostering my abilities to create applications and models that enhance everyday life. I am drawn to complex problems, and even more so captivated by deriving elegant solutions. My personal work and research typically reflects my strong interest in Full-Stack and Backend Development as well as exploring modern front-end frameworks. While enjoying my undergraduate experience at the University of Virginia, I look forward to further broadening my breadth of knowledge, opportunities, and experiences.

### **Experience**

My early professional career is diverse. I seek out opportunities that truly excite me and offer new perspectives. I spent months as a DevOps manager developing a University Web Application, interned for two technology startups, researched and presented on various hospital acquired infections, volunteer to establish a sustainable housing community, and represent my class through student council. As I am fully immersed into a new opportunity, I continously find satisfaction in reaching solutions, breakthroughs, or accomplishments. I am thankful for how each experience has shaped my mindset and skills and has even inspired me in my own projects. There is something valuable I have taken away from each project, team member, and situation.

Currently, I work as an undergraduate researcher with the [UVA Biocomplexity Insitute](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/) in the Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing (NSAAC) divison. Here I have collaborated closely with Dr. Anil Vullikanti and Dr. Chen Chen on finding solutions to reduce the spread of hospital aquired infections using data science, graph theory, and machine learning algorithms. Please check back to my page soon for future publications and more information.

This summer, I had the privilege to intern as a Software Engineer for [Legna Software](https://www.legnasoftware.com/).
